### DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

- The project uses the build tool [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/)

- You can reach the development state using the command:

```
yarn dev
```

- The resulting files are then in the memory and http server start at 
  http://localhost:3000

- Achieving the deployment state can be done with the command:

```
yarn build
```

The resulting files are then in the `./dist` directory

Please run yarn build before every commit
